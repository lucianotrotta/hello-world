# hello-world

Hello, everyone.

I'm taking my first steps into using GitHub. Many things are new to me at this point, but I am a fast learner.

I used to program at school using BASIC (yep, I'm in that generation). For reasons beyond the scope of this edit, 
I didn't took on programming again until much later in life. So, here I am... much later in life, working on C#, VB 
and Python as my main languages.
